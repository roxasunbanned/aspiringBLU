# aspiringBlu

## Overview
aspiringBlu is a project designed to help learn Blue Magic.

## Features
- Zone Checker: Each time you change zones, it will check if there are any Blue Magic spells unlearned in the area; if there are, it will list all the spells and the mobs. You can learn them from, accompanied by a text and speech sound.
- New Blue Magic Used: When a mob uses a spell you have not learned, it will play a text to speech sound and become targetable by using the command `//targetblu`. This will help if you are farming them in groups.
- New Blue Magic Learned: Once you have learned a new spell a text to speech sound will play to verify you have learned the spell and not missed it in the swarm of RoE text.
